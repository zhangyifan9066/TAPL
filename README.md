# TAPL

This is a course project for TAPL (Types and Programming Languages). The goal is to implement a simple typed language with Ocaml. The basic implementation (arithmetic expression) is an from resouces page of this course ([here](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/checkers/arith.tar.gz)). And I'm here to extend this basic implementation to a fully functional one step by step.
